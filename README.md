# Piano-Teaching-Project

About the project:
----
The prototype is described as a two-player electronic device aimed for learning how to read musical notes and associate them with their corresponding audio keynotes.

It employs flashcards that contain piano keynote symbols, associated with Bass and Treble clefs. The prototype also plays the desired piano keynote sound.
